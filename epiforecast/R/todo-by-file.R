## xxx instead of n.out, allow NA's in the future trajectories, just fill in all; use !is.na as another ii.match mask?
## todo explicitly make object that represents a distribution of curves, corresponding fitting functions, then the conditioning method?
## todo rename forecast time to something with "ind"?
